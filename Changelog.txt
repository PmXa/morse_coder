My Own Real Sketch (MORSke)

Version 0.04
A dictionary is included as a library to fully translate a message!

Version 0.03
A simple function is used to translate vowels to morse code.

Version 0.02
Learned to use a for loop. This way, every character of a message can be translated. Next version will try to learn how to use functions!

Version 0.01
To this point I've just bought an Elegoo Arduino board. I'm learning the basics! I used this sketch to learn how to declare, define and print variables, which will be useful when actually translating every character in a message to morse code.
